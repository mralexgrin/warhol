   WARHOL SCOUT — SEED, GENERATED FROM REAL OBSERVATIONS
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Written by `warhol export --brief worth-call-they-make` on 2026-08-06.
   Do not edit by hand; re-run the command.

   Classic script. Sets window.WARHOL. No modules, no fetch, no network.
   Drop-in replacement for the frozen cohort file of the same name.

   THESE CREATORS ARE REAL. That is the point of this file and it is also the
   thing to be careful about: every inventory line, every status code and every
   "we looked in N places" below traces to a URL the engine actually opened, on
   the date recorded. Run `warhol checks <handle>` in the engine to open them.

   WHAT IS REAL HERE
     inventory, checks, scores, confidence, platforms, audience, evidence

   WHAT IS INVENTED, AND MARKED
     headline, accent, samples, play, outreach

   Every invented field carries `generated: true`. They are real product
   features that are not built rather than oversights, and a demo that cannot
   tell you which half is which is worse than one running entirely on fiction.
   Nothing below fabricates a quote: the evidence array contains only text the
   engine fetched and the model quoted verbatim from it.

   The v1.3 layer (v52-seed.js) carries no V13 entry for anyone here, so it
   derives their reading from these records. That is deliberate — V13 is the
   authored half, and there is nobody to author.
